# Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

In this assignment, I constructed a machine learning model that attempted to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. 

## Background

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. With this data I created machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, comparing the Logistic Regression model to the Random Forest Classifier.

## Prediction

Prediction= That the Random Forest Classifer will display the data better then the logistic regression classification, due to it's ability of manging more diverse datasets into decision trees by using averages for better predictions and evalutions.

### Conclusion

The Random Forest Classifier performed better then the Logistic Regression Model by 0.005 in terms of accuracy, however the Logistic Regression Model provided more information and was easier to interpret the data. With that being said the Logistic Regression Model would be the better model to use when making prediction and forming conclusions on the Loans.
